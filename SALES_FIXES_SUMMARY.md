  // Dashboard > Sales > Performance > Leaderboard
  Breadcrumbs::for('sales.performance.leaderboard', function (BreadcrumbTrail $trail) {
      $trail->parent('sales.performance');
      $trail->push(trans('sales::app.performance.leaderboard'), route('admin.sales.performance.leaderboard'));
  });
  ```
